3. ~~Help documentation not updated~~ ✅ FIXED

## 🔴 BATCH 1: CRITICAL - App Won't Work ✅ FIXED

These issues prevented the Fix Assistant from opening.

### Issue 1.1: `State.fixes` is Never Set ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Fix Assistant modal refuses to open ("No fixes available to review")  
**Location:** `static/js/app.js`  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**  
The FAV2 integration code checked `if (!State.fixes || State.fixes.length === 0)` but `State.fixes` was never assigned.

**Fix Applied:**  
Added after line 1007 in app.js:
```javascript
// v3.0.97b: Populate State.fixes for Fix Assistant v2
State.fixes = (State.issues || []).filter(issue => 
    issue.suggestion && 
    issue.suggestion !== '-' && 
    issue.suggestion.trim() !== '' &&
    issue.flagged_text
);
```

### Issue 1.2: Backend Missing FAV2 Data Fields ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** DocumentViewer shows blank, MiniMap shows no markers  
**Location:** `app.py` - `/api/review` endpoint  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**  
Review endpoint response didn't include `document_content`, `fix_groups`, `confidence_details`, `fix_statistics`.

**Fix Applied:**  
Added to `/api/review` and `/api/review/result/<job_id>` endpoints:
```python
# v3.0.97b: Add Fix Assistant v2 enhancement data
response_data['document_content'] = build_document_content(results)
response_data['fix_groups'] = group_similar_fixes(issues)
response_data['confidence_details'] = build_confidence_details(issues)
response_data['fix_statistics'] = compute_fix_statistics(...)
```
